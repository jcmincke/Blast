# Blast: Distributed Computing in Haskell

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcmincke/Blast.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcmincke/Blast)

**Blast** is a pure Haskell library for doing distributed computing. It has the following characteristics:

* Works on any RPC backend. The current implementation runs on both local threads and CloudHaskell.
* Is based on 5 simple primitives, allowing the user to define his own syntax above them.
* Has a buit-in fail/safe mechanism in case of slave failure.
* Transparently works with both stateless and stateful slaves.
* Automatically handles slave caching.


## Getting started

```
$ stack build
```

Builds the library and the examples.

## Examples

Each example can be run on 2 backends:

* A local backend that uses local threads.
* A CloudHaskell backend.

To run an example on CloudHaskell:

* Edit `Main.hs` and choose the right CloudHaskell main function (the one that is suffixed with CH).
* Starts as many slaves as needed.

```
$ stack exec -- example-name slave host port
```
* Starts the master.
```
$ stack exec -- example-name master host port
```

I.E. The following commands starts the KMean example with 2 slaves.

```
$ stack exec -- kmeans slave localhost 5001
$ stack exec -- kmeans slave localhost 5002
$ stack exec -- kmeans master localhost 5000
```

### Simple

A set a simple examples illustrating remote mapping and folding as well as an iterative distributed algorithm.

```
$ stack exec -- simple
```

### KMeans

Implementation of the distributed KMean algorithm.

```
$ stack exec -- kmeans
```

### WordCount

Counts the number of occurrences of each character in multiple files.

```
$ cd examples/WordCount
$ stack exec -- wordcount
```
